## **8.1 Overview**

In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to compute spatial weights using R. By the end to this hands-on exercise, we will be able to:

-   import geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of **sf** package,

-   import csv file using appropriate function of **readr** package,

-   perform relational join using appropriate join function of **dplyr** package,

-   compute spatial weights using appropriate functions of **spdep** package, and

-   calculate spatially lagged variables using appropriate functions of **spdep** package.

## **8.2 The Study Area and Data**

Two data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:

-   Hunan county boundary layer. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.

-   Hunan_2012.csv: This csv file (aspatial) contains selected Hunan's local development indicators in 2012.

### **8.2.1 Getting Started**

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse, knitr)
```

## **8.3 Getting the Data Into R Environment**

**8.3.1 Import shapefile into r environment**

The code chunk below uses [*st_read()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_read.html) of **sf** package to import Hunan shapefile into R. The imported shapefile will be **simple features** Object of **sf**.

```{r}
hunan <- st_read(dsn='data/geospatial',
                 layer = 'Hunan')
class(hunan)
```

`hunan` is in WSG84 coordinate system.

```{r}
head(hunan,3) %>% kable()
```

### **8.3.2 Import csv file into r environment**

Next, we will import *Hunan_2012.csv* into R by using *read_csv()* of **readr** package. The output is R dataframe class.

```{r}
hunan2012 <- read_csv('data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv')
head(hunan2012,3) %>% kable()
```

### **8.3.3 Performing relational join**

The code chunk below will be used to update the attribute table of *hunan*'s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of *hunan2012* dataframe. This is performed by using *left_join()* of **dplyr** package.

As the join columns are not specified, this function will assume that columns with the same names, e.g., 'county' in both dfs will be the join columns.

The select() will retain the columns indicated in the resulting joined df.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan, hunan2012) %>% 
  select(1:4,7,15)
class(hunan)
```

Note the geospatial characteristics of hunan is retained.

```{r}
head(hunan,3) %>% kable
```

## **8.4 Visualising Regional Development Indicator**

Now, we are going to prepare a basemap and a choropleth map showing the distribution of GDPPC 2012 by using *qtm()* of **tmap** package.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68
basemap <- tm_shape(hunan)+
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_text('NAME_3',
          size = 0.5)

gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan)+
  tm_polygons('GDPPC') +
    tm_layout(legend.height = 0.20, 
            legend.width = 0.25)
  
# or gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")

tmap_arrange(basemap, gdppc,
           asp=1,
           ncol=2)
```

## **8.5 Computing Contiguity Spatial Weights**

In this section, we will use [*poly2nb()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/poly2nb.html) of **spdep** package to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. **Use this if we know that for a variable, sharing common boundary increases spatial interaction.**

By default, 'queen' argument is set to TRUE: two polygons sharing one shared boundary point will meet contiguity condition. Returns a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.

If 'queen' argument is set to FALSE: requires more than one shared boundary point. (but may not mean a shared boundary line)

### **8.5.1 Computing (QUEEN) contiguity based neighbours**

The code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_q <- poly2nb(hunan, queen=TRUE)
summary(wm_q)
```

The summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one heighbours.

`wm_q` (weights matrix queen) **class: 'nb'**

```{r}
class(wm_q)
```

A quick peak at `wm_q`

```{r}
head(wm_q,3)
```

For each polygon in our polygon object, *wm_q* lists all neighboring polygons. For example, to see the neighbors for the first polygon in the object, type:

```{r}
wm_q[[1]]
```

Polygon 1 has 5 neighbors. The numbers represent the polygon IDs as stored in hunan SpatialPolygonsDataFrame class.

We can retrive the county name of Polygon ID=1 by using the code chunk below:

```{r}
hunan$County[1]
```

Polygon ID=1 is Anxiang county.

To reveal the county names of the five neighboring polygons, the code chunk will be used:

```{r}
x1 <- wm_q[[1]]
hunan$County[c(x1)]
```

The printed output above shows that the GDPPC of the five nearest neighbours based on Queen's method are 20981, 34592, 24473, 21311 and 22879 respectively.

To display the complete weight matrix, use *str()*

```{r}
str(wm_q)
#wm_q[1:10]
#methods(class = class(wm_q))

```

### **8.5.2 Creating (ROOK) contiguity based neighbours**

The code chunk below is used to compute Rook contiguity weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_r <- poly2nb(hunan, queen=FALSE)
summary(wm_r)
```

The summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connect area unit has 10 neighbours. There are two area units with only one heighbours.

### 8.5.3 Visualising contiguity weights (find centroid coords first)

A connectivity graph takes a point and displays a line to each neighbouring point.

-   need a point in polygon via polygon centroids (its lat & long) \<- calculate using the sf package first

To obtain coordinates in a separate data frame

1.  input vector is the geometry column of us.bound (in `hunan`), an sf object \<- a polygon

    Using hunan\$geometry\[\[1\]\]: The input vector of the FIRST POLYGON looks like POLYGON ((112.0625 29.75523, 112.069 29.74544, 112.0707 29.7415, 112.0716 29.73667, .... , 112.0625 29.75523).

2.  To find the centroid (CG) of one polygon, use the `st_centroid()` function, which is a formula shorthand for a small anonymous function (lambda function). It takes an argument represented by **`.x`**. `st_centroid(.x)[[1]]` extracts the X-coordinate (longitude) of the centroid while `st_centroid(.x)[[2]]` extracts the Y-coords.

    ::: panel-tabset
    #### X and Y

    ```{r}
    #hunan$geometry[[1]]
    st_centroid(hunan$geometry[[1]])
    ```

    #### X only

    ```{r}
    st_centroid(hunan$geometry[[1]])[[1]]
    ```

    #### Y only

    ```{r}
    st_centroid(hunan$geometry[[1]])[[2]]
    ```
    :::

**`map_dbl(...)`** is a function from the **`purrr`** package that applies a function to each element of a list or vector and returns the results as a double vector. In this case, the function being applied is the expression following **`~`**. Example of how this function is used in a simple way:

```{r}
# Example list of vectors
list_of_vectors <- list(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6), c = c(7, 8, 9))

# Applying a function to calculate the sum of each vector
map_dbl(list_of_vectors, ~ sum(.x))

```

After finding centroid, to access longitude values

-   double bracket notation \[\[ \]\] and 1

    ```{r}
    longitude <- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])
    longitude
    ```

To access the latitude value

-   double bracket notation \[\[ \]\] and 2

    ```{r}
    latitude <- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])
    ```

With both longitude and latitude, use cbind() to combine both in the same object,

```{r}
coords <- cbind(longitude, latitude)
head(coords)
```

#### 8.5.3.1 Plotting Queen contiguity based neighbours map

wm\_ q is weight matrix using queen method (88 rows of list of neighbours)

coords is an array of x,y coordinates of centroids for each of the 88 counties

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.6
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main="Queen's contiguity")
plot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= "red")
```

> Use the [plot()](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/plot-function-in-r) function
>
> 1.  **The shape of the markers:** The plot markers are by default small, empty circles. These are also known as plot characters - denoted by **pch**. Pch values 0 to 25 are valid and give several different symbols on the graph. **Pch** 0 is for a square, 1 is for a circle, 3 is for a triangle, 4 is for a cross and so on.
>
> 2.  **Size of the plot markers**: The **cex** parameter can be set to 0.5 if we want the markers to be 50% smaller and 1.5 if wewant them to be 50% larger.
>
> 3.  **Color of the plot markers:** These colors can be selected from a list provided by R under the `colors()` function.

#### 8.5.3.2 Plotting Rook contiguity based neighbours map

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68
plot(hunan$geometry, border = 'lightgrey', main='Rooks contiguity')
plot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col ="blue")
```

#### 8.5.3.3 Plotting both Queen and Rook contiguity based neighbours maps side-by-side

`par(mfrow = c(1, 2))` arranges subsequent plots in a grid with **one** row and **two** columns

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main="Queen's contiguity")
plot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= "red", main="Queen Contiguity")
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey",main="Rook's contiguity")
plot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = "blue", main="Rook Contiguity")
```

## 8.6 Computing distance based neighbours

-   In this section, we will derive distance-based weight matrices by using [*dnearneigh()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/dnearneigh.html) of **spdep** package.

    | dnearneigh(x, d1, d2, row.names = NULL, longlat = NULL, bounds=c("GE", "LE"),
    |  use_kd_tree=TRUE, symtest=FALSE, use_s2=packageVersion("s2") \> "1.0.7", k=200,
    |  dwithin=TRUE)

-   identifies neighbours using distance band with lower d1= and upper d2= bounds controlled by the `bounds=` argument

-   If unprojected coordinates are used (WSG84 geographic) and either specified in the coordinates object x or with x as a two column matrix and longlat=TRUE, great circle distances in **km** will be calculated assuming the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.

### **8.6.1 Determine the cut-off distance**

Firstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:

-   Return a **matrix** with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using [*knearneigh()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knearneigh.html) of **spdep**. **Class: 'knn'**. Output: NN of poly1 = poly3, NN of poly2 = poly 78 etc...

    ```{r}
    str(knearneigh(coords,
               k=1))
    #knearneigh(coords,k=1)['nn']  #<< shows matrix
    ```

-   Convert the matrix knn object returned by *knearneigh()* into a neighbours **list** with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using [*knn2nb()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knn2nb.html). **Class: nb**

    ```{r}
    knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))[1:5]
    ```

-   Return a list of the **length** (the distance to one's nearest neighbour) of neighbour relationship edges by using [*nbdists()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nbdists.html) of **spdep**. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km if in WSG84. **Class: 'nbdist'**

    ```{r}
    nbdists(knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=1)),
            coords,
            longlat = TRUE) [1:5]
    ```

-   Remove the list structure of the returned object by using [**unlist()**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/unlist). **Class of k1dists: numeric.**

    Output: 25.53398 43.03114 25.53398 29.28480 29.28480 45.98097 58.52704 28.95985 34.45062 37.99885 44.49442 33.48816 35.98123

    ```{r}
    k1 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=1))
    k1dists <- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))
    summary(k1dists)
    ```

**The summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79. So using this as the upper threshold (62km) will help to ensure that all units (polygons) will have at least one neighbour**.

### 8.6.2 Computing [fixed]{.underline} distance weight matrix

(Earlier, we had used `poly2nb(hunan, queen=TRUE/FALSE)` to define neighbours using Queen or Rook method, resulting in `wm_q` and `wm_r.`)

(We also have `k1` of 'nb' class where each polygon has 1 nb. Additionally, we used summary(unlist(nbdists())) to calculate the distance between furthest neighbours.)

Now, to define neighbours using a **distance threshold**, we use the `dnearneigh()` ,

-   *longlat argument: TRUE if point coordinates are **geographical** longitude-latitude decimal degrees (WSG84)*
-   some polygons have more than 1 nb, but all polygons have at least 1 nb here due to distance threshold.

```{r}
wm_d62 <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat=TRUE )
wm_d62
```

Average number of links is calculated by dividing the total number of links by the number of regions. On average, each region has approximately 3.68 neighboring regions. **Class of `wm_d62`: 'nb'**

```{r}
class(wm_d62)
```

Next, we will use *str()* to display the content of wm_d62 weight matrix.

```{r}
str(wm_d62)
```

Another way to display the structure of the weight matrix is to combine [*table()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/table) and [*card()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/card.html) of spdep.

The column headers "1" means the count of counties that have 1 neighbor within the specified distance of 62km, "2" means the count of counties that have 2 neighbors, and so on.

```{r}
table(hunan$County, card(wm_d62))
```

TO find the number of connected components (aka see if there are any spatial units / regions without a neighbour)

```{r}
n_comp <- n.comp.nb(wm_d62)
n_comp$nc
```

In this connected component, there are 88 elements (spatial units)

```{r}
table(n_comp$comp.id)
```

#### 8.6.2.1 Plotting fixed distance weight matrix

Next, we will plot the distance weight matrix by using the code chunk below.

-   wm_d62 is the fixed distance weight matrix,

-   coords refers to long, lat coordinates for CG of each polygon

-   k1 is the list of integer ID of the polygon which is the nearest neighbour to me. The topmost layer of the plot colours the nearest neighbour edge to red colour.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey")
plot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE)
plot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col="red", length=0.08) 
```

The red lines shows the links of 1st nearest neighbours and the black lines show the lines of neighbours within the cut-off distance of 62km.

To plot red and black side by side,

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main = 'Neighbours within 62 km')
plot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE)
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main = 'Nearest Neighbour')
plot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col="red", length=0.08) 
```

### **8.6.3 Computing adaptive distance weight matrix**

**Use this method if the dataset is highly skewed to fix the \# of nbs.**

Earlier, we used `k1 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=1))` and `wm_d62 <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat=TRUE )` to plot maps of nearest nb and nbs within 62km range.

One of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.

It is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below. **class of `knn6`: 'nb'**

```{r}
knn6 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=6))
knn6
```

Similarly, we can display the content of the matrix by using *str()*. Note that each spatial units has exactly 6 neighbours.

```{r}
str(knn6)
```

#### 8.6.3.1 Plotting distance based neighbours

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68
plot(st_geometry(hunan), border = 'lightgray')
plot(knn6, coords, pch=18, cex=0.6, add= TRUE, col='red')
```

## **8.7 Weights based on Inverse Distance Method**

In this section, we will learn how to derive a spatial weight matrix based on Inversed Distance method. **This will assign greater weightage to closer polygons, use this if we know that closer proximity will result in more spatial interaction.**

Earlier, we applied nbdists() `nbdists(knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=1)), coords, longlat = TRUE)` to compute the distance of one's nearest neighbour.

First, we will compute the distances between areas (defined using Queen contiguity method) by using [*nbdists()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nbdists.html) of **spdep**. **Class of dist: nbdist**

```{r}
dist <- nbdists(wm_q, coords, longlat=TRUE)
head(dist,3)
```

Now compute the inverse distances for all polygons to their neighbours. **Class of ids: matrix of list.** `ids` is also glist (general weights for each nb).

```{r}
ids <- lapply(dist, function(x) 1/(x))
head(ids,3)
```

### **8.7.1 Row-standardised weights matrix**

`nb2listw(neighbours, glist=NULL, style="W", zero.policy=NULL)`

Arguments

| `neighbours`  | an object of class `nb`                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `glist`       | list of general weights corresponding to neighbours                                                                                                                         |
| `style`       | `style` can take values "W", "B", "C", "U", "minmax" and "S"                                                                                                                |
| `zero.policy` | default NULL, use global option value; if FALSE stop with error for any empty neighbour sets, if TRUE permit the weights list to be formed with zero-length weights vectors |

**Details**

Starting from a binary neighbours list, in which regions are either listed as neighbours or are absent (thus not in the set of neighbours for some definition), the function adds a weights list with values given by the coding scheme style chosen.

Weights to each neighboring polygon

-   each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style="W") \<- row standardised. This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values

-   drawback of this method is that polygon along the edge will base their lagged values on fewer polygons, thus over estimating the true nature of spatial autocorrelation in the data. Next time can consider other more robust options are available, notably style="B" \<- basic binary coding

-   The zero.policy=TRUE option allows for lists of non-neighbors. This should be used with caution since the user may not be aware of missing neighbors in their dataset however, a zero.policy of FALSE would return an error. **Class of rsmq_q = 'listw' and 'nb'**

::: panel-tabset
#### style = 'W'

```{r}
# wm_q is a matrix containing nb indexes
rswm_q <- nb2listw(wm_q, style = 'W', zero.policy = TRUE)
rswm_q
```

#### style = 'B'

```{r}
nb2listw(wm_q, style = 'B', zero.policy = TRUE)$weights[1]
```
:::

```{r}
class(rswm_q)
```

To see the weight of the first polygon's 5 neighbours type:

```{r}
rswm_q$weights[1]
```

The 5 neighbours are

```{r}
rswm_q$neighbours[1]
```

Explanation of above: Each neighbor is assigned a 0.125 of the total weight. This means that when R computes the average neighboring income values, each **neighbor's income will be multiplied by 0.125 before being tallied.**

Using the same queen's method, we can also derive a (row standardised ?) inverse-distance weight matrix by using the code chunk below. Recall `ids` contains inverse-distances to neighbours, also our glist (general weights of neighbours) , originally from queens `wm_q` which is a neighbour structure. We will now use `nb2listw()` and `wm_q` and `ids` to create a spatial weights matrix. **Class of rswm_ids is 'listw' and 'nb'.** It contains 3 lists, 'style' of class character ,'neighbours' of class nb, 'weights' of class nb

```{r}
rswm_ids <- nb2listw(wm_q, glist=ids, style ='W', zero.policy=TRUE)
rswm_ids
```

To see the weights of the 1st polygon; it is actually the similar as `ids`, but not identical.

```{r}
rswm_ids$weights[1]
```

```{r}
summary(unlist(rswm_ids$weights))
```

Finally, a comparison of the weights for polygon 1 across three spatial weights methods:

```{r}
a <- unlist(rswm_q$weights[1])
b <- unlist(nb2listw(wm_q, style = 'B', zero.policy = TRUE)$weights[1])
c <- unlist(rswm_ids$weights[1])

weights_comparison <- as.data.frame(cbind(a,b,c))
colnames(weights_comparison) <- c("row standardised", "binary", 'row standardised inverse distance')
weights_comparison
```

## **8.8 Application of Spatial Weight Matrix**

In this section, you will learn how to create four different spatial lagged variables, they are:

-   spatial lag with row-standardized weights,

-   spatial lag as a sum of neighbouring values,

-   spatial window average, and

-   spatial window sum.

### 8.8.1 Spatial lag with row-standardized weights

-   compute the average neighbour GDPCC values for each polygon

-   commonly called spatially lagged values

-   does not include itself

-   Recalled in the previous section, we retrieved the GDPPC of these five countries (neighbours of poly1 using queen method) by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
x1 <- wm_q[[1]]
hunan$GDPPC[c(x1)]
```

-   Now we compute the row-standardised lag variable using `lag.listw()` and `rsqm_q` (neighbour structure).

-   In the code below, use spatial weight matrix (equal weightage of 0.2 for poly1 etc.. ) by 0.2 \* 20981 + 0.2 \* 34592 + 0.2 \* 24473 + 0.2 \* 21311 + 0.2 \* 22879 = 24847.20 for poly1 "Anxiang"

-   22724.80 is the average GDPPC for poly2 based on equal weightage (0.2) of all its five neighbours . 24143.25 for poly3 based on equal weightage (0.25) based on four neighbours.

```{r}
GDPPC.lag <- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)
GDPPC.lag
```

We can append the spatially lag GDPPC values onto hunan sf data frame by using the code chunk below.

First, create `lag.list` that contains two **individual** lists, namely NAME_3 column in `hunan` and the lag variable. Next, transform both lists into a dataframe. Rename the column headers. Perform a left join with hunan and lag.res will automatically use `NAME_3` column as the join column.

```{r}

The following table shows the average neighboring income values (stored in the Inc.lag object) for each county.

Next, we will plot both the GDPPC and spatial lag GDPPC for comparison using the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68
gdppc <- qtm(hunan, 'GDPPC') +
    tm_layout(main.title='No lag variable',
              legend.height = 0.2,
              legend.width=0.2)
lag_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, 'lag GDPPC') +
  tm_layout(main.title='With lag variable (Row-stand)',
            legend.height = 0.2,
            legend.width=0.4)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, lag_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

::: callout-note
The chart on the left plots the original GDPPC values of respective spatial units. The chart on the right plots the average GDPPC values of all spatial units that shares a boundary (Queen) for a particular spatial unit. Does not include diagonal (own's) GDPPC value.

Compute lag variable using rswm_ids (inverse-distance method)

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68
lag.list.2 <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(rswm_ids, hunan$GDPPC))
str(lag.list.2)
lag.res.2 <- as.data.frame(lag.list.2)
colnames(lag.res.2) <- c("NAME_3", "lag GDPPC ID")
hunan <- left_join(hunan,lag.res.2)

head(as_tibble(hunan),3)

lag_gdppc_id <- qtm(hunan, 'lag GDPPC ID') +
  tm_layout(main.title='With lag variable (Inv_dist)',
            legend.height = 0.2,

**Lag variable using Queen's contiguity (Row standardised weight matrix)**

The lag variable represents the spatial AVERAGE of GDPPC for neighbouring areas based on Queen contiguity.

**Lag variable using Inverse-Distance Weight matrix**

The lag variable is calculated as a WEIGHTED AVERAGE of GDPPC. Further neighbours are penalised (assign lesser weights) when we use inverse-distance.
:::

### **8.8.2 Spatial lag as a sum of neighboring values**

**Part 1: Obtain binary weights matrix called \'b_weights\' (glist):**

wm_q (aka neighbour list) is a \'nb\' class containing neighbour IDs for each polygon. E.g. Neighbours list of the first three polygons:

```{r}
#| echo: false
wm_q[1:3]
```

To create a binary list, we will now apply lambda function of 0\*neighbour ID + 1 ; so that if there is a neighbour, the value is 1. Class of b_weights is a matrix with lists of 1 .

Similar to `ids` earlier, b_weights is the glist (general weights corresponding to neighbours). We need the neighbour structure `wm_q` and `glist` to convert to spatial weights matrix using `nb2listw()`.

```{r}
b_weights <- lapply(wm_q, function(x) 0*x+1)
class(b_weights)
b_weights[1:3]
```

**Part 2: Create the spatial weights matrix using nb2listw() , `wm_q` (neighbour structure) and `b_weights`** (glist)

```{r}
b_weights2 <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                       glist = b_weights, 
                       style = "B")
b_weights2
```

Sneakpeak at b_weights2

```{r}
b_weights2$weights[1:3]
```

With the proper weights assigned, we can use lag.listw to compute a lag variable from our weight and GDPPC. Since the weights are all '1's, we will be summing all our neighbours' GDPPC.

lag_sum contains two lists, namely `NAME_3` and `lag_sum GDPPC`. Combine both lists into a df. Rename the df column headers.

```{r}
lag_sum <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(b_weights2, hunan$GDPPC))
str(lag_sum)

lag.res <- as.data.frame(lag_sum)
colnames(lag.res) <- c('NAME_3', 'lag_sum GDPPC')
```

Next, append `lag.res` to `hunan` sf dataframe

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan, lag.res)
```

Plot both the *GDPPC* and *Spatial Lag Sum GDPPC* for comparison using the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68
gdppc <- qtm(hunan, 'GDPPC') +
    tm_layout(main.title='No lag variable',
              legend.height = 0.2,
              legend.width=0.2)

lag_sum_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, 'lag_sum GDPPC') +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'spatial lag as lag sum of nb values',
            legend.height = 0.2,
            legend.width=0.2)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, lag_sum_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

::: callout-note
The lag variable created by summing up neighbours' GDPPC look more alike the lag variable created using inverse-distance weights matrix.
:::

### 8.8.3 Spatial window average

-   must use row-standardized weights

-   similar to 8.8.1 but only difference is that it includes the diagonal element;

-   To include diagonal in R, we need to go back to the neighbors structure `wm_q` and add the diagonal element before assigning weights.

```{r}
# weight matrix queen self
wm_qs <- include.self(wm_q)
wm_qs
wm_qs[1:3]
```

We can see that polygon 1 has its diagonal (1) inside and polygon 2 has its diagonal (2) inside.We can see that polygon 1 has its diagonal (1) inside and polygon 2 has its diagonal (2) inside.

As expected, the Number of nonzero links, Percentage nonzero weights and Average number of links are 536, 6.921488 and 6.090909 respectively as compared to wm_q of 448, 5.785124 and 5.090909.

Now, proceed to create the spatial weights matrix that includes self:

Default style is 'W' - row standardised.

```{r}
wm_qs <- nb2listw(wm_qs, style ='W', zero.policy = TRUE)
wm_qs$weights[1:3]
```

Now, create lag variable using spatial weights matrix `wm_qs` and `hunan$GDPCC` variable:

```{r}
lag_w_ave_gdppc <- lag.listw(wm_qs,
                             hunan$GDPPC)
lag_w_ave_gdppc
```

Append `lag_w_ave_gdppc` to the `hunan` dataframe by using the series of steps below:

```{r}
lag.list.wm_qs <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(wm_qs, hunan$GDPPC))
str(lag.list.wm_qs)
lag_wm_qs.res <- as.data.frame(lag.list.wm_qs)
colnames(lag_wm_qs.res) <- c('NAME_3', 'lag_window_avg GDPPC')

hunan <- left_join(hunan, lag_wm_qs.res)

hunan %>% 
  select('County', 'lag GDPPC', 'lag_window_avg GDPPC') %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kable()

#as_tibble(hunan)  #<< will isolate the geometry part
```

Use dtm() to plot 'lag GDPPC' and 'lag_window_avg GDPPC' side-by-side

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68

W_avg_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, 'lag_window_avg GDPPC') +
  tm_layout(main.title='With lag_sum variable',
            legend.height = 0.2,
            legend.width=0.4)

tmap_arrange(lag_gdppc, W_avg_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)

```

::: callout-note
Both charts use row-standardised spatial weights matrix.

Difference between charts is that left does not include self's GDPPC but the right includes self's GDPPC.
:::

### **8.8.4 Spatial window sum**

The spatial window sum is the counter part of the window average, but without using row-standardized weights. (similar to 8.8.2 but including self)

To add the diagonal element to the neighbour list, we just need to use *include.self()* from **spdep**.

```{r}
wm_qs <- include.self(wm_q)
wm_qs
```

Next, we will assign binary **general** weights to the neighbour structure that includes the diagonal element.

```{r}
b_weights <- lapply(wm_qs, function(x) 0*x + 1)
b_weights[1:3]
```

Each spatial unit has one more element, that is itself.

Again, we use *`nb2listw()`* and `wm_qs` (nb structure) and `b_weights` (glist) to create **spatial** weights matrix `b_weights`

```{r}
b_weights2 <- nb2listw(wm_qs, 
                       glist = b_weights, 
                       style = "B")
b_weights2
```

Compute the window sum lag variable using `lag.listw()`, `b_weights2` (spatial weights matrix) and `hunan$GDPCC` (variable). The below also appends the window sum lag variable to `hunan` df.

```{r}
w_sum_gdppc <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(b_weights2, hunan$GDPPC))
str(w_sum_gdppc)
w_sum_gdppc.res <- as.data.frame(w_sum_gdppc)
colnames(w_sum_gdppc.res) <- c("NAME_3", "w_sum GDPPC")

hunan <- left_join(hunan, w_sum_gdppc.res)
hunan %>%
  select("County", "lag_sum GDPPC", "w_sum GDPPC") %>%
  head() %>% 
  kable()
```

Lastly, *qtm()* of **tmap** package is used to plot the lag_sum GDPPC and w_sum_gdppc maps next to each other for quick comparison.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-asp: 0.68

W_sum_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, 'w_sum GDPPC') +
  tm_layout(main.title='With lag_win_sum variable',
            legend.height = 0.2,
            legend.width=0.4)

tmap_arrange(lag_sum_gdppc, W_sum_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)

```

::: callout-note
Both charts do not use row-standardised spatial matrix, instead they use binary '1' because of the need to sum up the GDPPC values. Difference is that left does not include self but right includes self.

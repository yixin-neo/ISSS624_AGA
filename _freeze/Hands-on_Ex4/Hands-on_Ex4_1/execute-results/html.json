In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to build [hedonic pricing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedonicpricing.asp) models by using GWR methods. The dependent variable is the resale prices of condominium in 2015. The independent variables are divided into either structural and locational.\n\n## **13.2 The Data**\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this model building exercise, they are:\n\n-   URA Master Plan subzone boundary in shapefile format (i.e. *MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL*)\n\n-   condo_resale_2015 in csv format (i.e. *condo_resale_2015.csv*)\n\n## **13.3 Getting Started**\n\nBefore we get started, it is important for us to install the necessary R packages into R and launch these R packages into R environment.\n\nThe R packages needed for this exercise are as follows:\n\n-   R package for building OLS and performing diagnostics tests\n\n    -   [**olsrr**](https://olsrr.rsquaredacademy.com/)\n\n-   R package for calibrating geographical weighted family of models\n\n    -   [**GWmodel**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWmodel/)\n\n-   R package for multivariate data visualisation and analysis\n\n    -   [**corrplot**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html)\n\n-   [ggpubr](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/) for some easy-to-use functions for creating and customizing 'ggplot2'- based publication ready plots.\n\n-   Spatial data handling\n\n    -   **sf** for importing, integrating, processing and transforming geospatial data.\n\n-   Attribute data handling\n\n    -   **tidyverse**, especially **readr**, **ggplot2** and **dplyr**\n\n-   Choropleth mapping\n\n    -   **tmap** for creating thematic maps\n\nThe code chunks below installs and launches these R packages into R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-width: 14\n#| fig-asp: 0.68\n#| code-fold: True\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Summaries\n",
